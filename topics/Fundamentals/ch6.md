## Chapter 6: The End of Fundamentals

To me, it seems you have been presented with enough information to really take off running
with all of this. Building things with all of this new found knowledge tends to be intimidating,
but breaking things down to their essential parts really helps with making progress. That is why,
there is actually a website to go along with this learning. This was made with the intent of guiding
your learning through practical applications, and giving you an experience of seeing some of your efforts
more visually. Another added benefit is that most readers will have had experience with a web browser,
and visiting websites online, so you may already have one installed.

There also will be more related readings regarding some more topics related to programming, algorithms, and
resources to find more information on particular topics. Initially, there will also be some setup
to begin going through so that you can install a code editor, and all of the extensions that are needed
to help you have a more professional setting (convenient as well). Several considerations come in to play
when setting up one's development environment, but being exposed to your options will play just as
big a part being able to use it. Just like most programs, the more you dig into it, the more it can
do for you. In this case especially, that means saving large amounts of time by setting yourself up
to help yourself.

Programming is a very broad topic, and almost all areas of study are affected by this. You could
specialize in Data Science, Networking, Security, Web Development, Devops, Graphics, Games,
Robotics, and Embeded Systems just to name a few. All of these topics each serve as an umbrella for
vast amounts of subdomains in each domain respectively. If you have a solid grip on the fundamentals
of programming and start recognizing these patterns, jumping to things like shell scripting can
start to almost be familiar without experience in that specific circumstance.

My hope here is not to select one of these disciplines for you, but to give you the tools to be
effective at any. The basics are still the basics across all of them. Programming is similar to other
disciplines, including music. At the beginning stages of music you end up memorizing how to play
songs, not truly understanding the underpinnings of the construction of each of the notes in those
songs. This is a necessary part of the process, and as you get better you start analyzing the song
in depth for multiple parts of its construction. One of the things I want to highlight is that
some people can get stuck in this phase though. This relies heavily on memorization, routine, and
using only what is familiar. Using such a process works fine, and some people do this their entire
careers. The thing is, at least in my opinion, these people are working much harder memorizing
things constantly to keep up, instead of understanding the inner workings of things. The same can
be said for programming. Taking the extra time to get closer to understanding something can end up saving
you incredible amounts of time in the future. Really, some of your career options may start to become
limited if you do not understand the process of automating your tasks in order to get more things
done on a daily basis.

The theme of this message is really to see this as a constant learning experience. There will be many
things that you learn that may not appear all that related at first, but you will envitably recognize
a pattern somewhere due to these. Honestly, a surprising amount of coding can be improved by taking
the time to write things in a thoughtful manner. Making sure readability is a primary concern will
help everyone in the long run. If done properly, it could even serve as documentation on how things
can be implemented, serving as learning material and being easily maintainable.

It is now your choice to jump into walking through the creation of a modern website, or going over
related reading material. I would encourage possibly starting with the beginning of the website section
to get a general feel and see what will be covered. This would make more sense than jumping
into the advanced reading sections, unless you are already familiar with many of these topics.
